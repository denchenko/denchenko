Hi, I’m Denis.
* Software engineer at [Twinby](https://twinby.com)
* Interested in system architecture and building maintainable systems
* Developing [HolyDOCs](https://github.com/holydocs) in my spare time — a project for keeping architecture docs alive by generating them directly from code, APIs, tests, etc.
